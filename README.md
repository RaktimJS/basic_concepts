## About Me

Hi, my name is Raktim, and I'm a senior high school student from a Tier 3 town named Pathsala, in the state of Assam, India.

I'm very passionate about Computers and Mathematics, and I enjoy building systems that integrate Math with Computer Programming. As this program is the kind of project I enjoy working on the most, building it solo was a lot of fun!

___

This app is built completely using Python and utilizes almost every Python concept from the 11th grade CBSE Computer Science syllabus (and very few concepts from 12th grade Computer Science).

___

## How was this made?

1. The app is written entirely in Python and is split into two files:  
   - `ten_math_functions.py` (the main entry point)  
   - `module.py` (contains all the math-related functions)
2. Uses modular programming with custom imports to separate logic from UI.
3. Implements standard operations using loops, conditionals, and arithmetic.
4. Demonstrates string handling and control flow through user input-driven menus.
5. A custom password-checking mechanism (`pswrd()` function) is also included as a bonus.

___

## What were the learnings?

1. Reinforced understanding of functions and modular code design.
2. Explored Pythonâ€™s built-in `math`, `os`, and `time` modules.
3. Practiced basic number theory through problems like Armstrong numbers, palindrome checks, and divisibility.
4. Understood the importance of clean CLI interaction and user feedback.
5. Got familiar with encoding concepts while building a password authentication function.

## How to run the program?

- Make sure Python is installed and added to your system path.
- Open a terminal in the project directory.
- Run the file: `ten_math_functions.py`
  Password: ```HelloWorld```
